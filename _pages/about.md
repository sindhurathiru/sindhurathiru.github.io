I am a data scientist with expertise in machine learning, full-stack development, and automation. Currently at Health Canada, I design and implement scalable solutions for data retrieval, reporting, and workflow automation using Python, SQL, and VBA — enhancing operational efficiency by over 95%. With a background in both biology and computer science, I have contributed to [cutting-edge research](/projects), publishing in IEEE and Cytometry Part A. My experience spans government, healthcare, and financial sectors, where I have optimized processes, improved decision-making, and earned recognition for excellence in customer service. Holding an MSc in Computing and a BSc in Biology with a Minor in Computer Science, I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems and drive meaningful impact.
