I am a recent MSc in Computing graduate from Queen's University, Canada. [My work](/sindhurathiru/projects) involved developing various machine learning-based analysis pipelines for imaging mass cytometry data - a new, high-throughput tissue imaging technology. I've worked extensively with Python machine learning and image processing libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, TensorFlow, PIL, etc. My work has been published in IEEE journals and I have presented my findings at various computing conferences. I've always been interested in the approach of using data-driven techniques to solve real world problems and am looking to expand my knowledge and experience.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/sindhurathiru/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
