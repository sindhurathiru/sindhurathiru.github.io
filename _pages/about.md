I am a recent MSc in Computing graduate from Queen's University, Canada. [My work](/projects) involved developing various machine learning-based analysis pipelines for imaging mass cytometry data - a new, high-throughput tissue imaging technology. I've worked extensively with Python machine learning and image processing libraries including:

<ul>
  <li>scikit-learn</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>TensorFlow</li>
  <li>PIL</li>
  <li>SimpleITK</li>
</ul>

My work has been published in [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) journals and I have presented my findings at various computing conferences. I've always been interested in the approach of using data-driven techniques to solve real world problems and am eager to expand my knowledge and experience. 

Let's work together! Please reach out to me by <a href = "mailto: sindhura.thirumal@gmail.com">email</a>.
