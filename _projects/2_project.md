<h2>Introduction</h2>

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a powerful tissue imaging technology that improves upon traditional imaging methods. It's capable of outputting a large amount of data, however the current analysis methods are fairly preliminary. Currently, the analytical pipeline is as follows:

<ol>
    <li>Export raw data using <i>MCD Viewer</i></li>
    <li>Import images from <i>MCD Viewer</i> into <i>CellProfiler</i> for cell segmentation</li>
    <li>Export generated masks from <i>CellProfiler</i> to the analysis software <i>histoCat</i></li>
    <li>Export resulting data for external analyses if necessary</li>
</ol>

In order to complete these tasks, three separate software - endorsed by the manufacturers of the Hyperionâ„¢ - are needed and require the unnecessary exportation of partial data results.

Although these software are the standard for analysis of IMC data, they are lacking in utility and require using multiple software for each of the tasks of visualization, segmentation, and analysis. In addition to issues in efficiency, there are certain pitfalls within the functionality of the software themselves, identified by users of these software.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

TITAN was developed within a free open-source software platform - [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) - for the purpose of addressing pitfalls and inefficienceis in the existing workflows for IMC analysis. It's compatible with both multi-channel text files and single-channel TIFF images of IMC data as inputs and provides an end-to-end pipeline for exploration and quantification of IMC data in a single environment.

TITAN uses several well-documented Python libraries including [Python Imaging Library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [SimpleITK](https://pypi.org/project/SimpleITK/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

TITAN is open-source and publicly available through its [Github repository](https://github.com/SlicerMicro/Slicer-TITAN) along with detailed documentation and tutorials.

<h3>Overview</h3>

TITAN's functionality is divided into 3 main categories:

<ol>
    <li>Visualization</li>
    <li>Segmentation</li>
    <li>Analysis</li>
</ol>

After importing IMC data in text or image format, the user can view individual protein channels as well as an overlay of multiple channels at once.










Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg
    ---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
